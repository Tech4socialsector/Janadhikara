      <!-- DoctypeList/DoctypeForm/EmailAccountForm reuse the same component
      instance when only a route param changes (different doctypeRoute or
      name, same route record) - Vue Router's default behavior. Their data
      loading (useMeta/useDoc/useNewDoc) runs once at setup and isn't wired
      to react to those params changing, so without a fresh mount per
      param value, navigating from one doctype/record to another via the
      sidebar silently kept showing the previous one until a hard refresh
      forced a real remount. Keying only these routes (not every route)
      keeps Home/Dashboard/Worklist - which have no such params - from
      remounting their shell on every navigation for no reason. -->

// generates the manifest live from App Setting.app_logo instead - swapping
// the link here (rather than templating janadhikara.html server-side)
// matches how the favicon itself is handled, and works from the very
// first load since it doesn't depend on any other resource resolving
